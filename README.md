### Abstract

This work presents software that prepares the DIVA-HisDB dataset for training purposes. The developed Python library supports a set of useful tools for manipulation and representation of its images and ground truths. With an extensible software architecture, we give users full control over the ground-truth process and allow for implementation of custom algorithms.
