## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DIVA-DIA/HisDB_GT_Refinement/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Abstract

This work presents software that prepares the DIVA-HisDB dataset for training purposes. The developed Python library supports a set of useful tools for manipulation and representation of its images and ground truths. With an extensible software architecture, we give users full control over the ground-truth process and allow for implementation of custom algorithms.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DIVA-DIA/HisDB_GT_Refinement/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
